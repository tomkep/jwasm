  1. What is generated code

  Some directives (and also instructions RET/IRET inside a procedure block)
  will generate source lines. In the listing file, those generated
  lines will be marked with a '*'.

  2. Where is generated code used?

  - invoke directive
  - hll directives (.if, .else, .while, .repeat, ...)
  - .model directive
  - .startup and .exit directives
  - simplified segment directives (.code, .data, .const, ...)
  - default PROC prologue and epilogue (when a RET/IRET is detected)
  - STRUCT data initialization (slightly peculiar)
