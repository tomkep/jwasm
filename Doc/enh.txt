  Possible Enhancements for JWasm

  1. support UNICODE strings. Similar to PoAsm? Most likely no,
     since using the DB/DW directives to define such strings 
     doesn't seem to be the best strategy. Might be better to 
     have an extra type for unicode strings (tchar), in 
     conjunction with a cmdline option to switch ansi/unicode.

  2. option FPO (frame pointer omission)? Probably not worth
     the efforts.

  3. unnamed RECORD within a STRUCT. Record field names
     will be local then and must be unique within the STRUCT. This
     feature will ease converting C include files to ASM.

     Syntax:

     operator WIDTH: ok
     operator MASK: ???

     S1 STRUCT
     f1  dd ?
     RECORD bit0:1, bit1:1
     S1  ends

     mov eax, MASK S1.bit0
     or v1.bit0 ???

  4. OPTION DLLIMPORT, OPTION NODLLIMPORT

     this will assume for PROTOs that the function is located in a 
     dll and can be called by using the IAT. Might be useful to enable
     this feature by a cmdline option.

  5. native support for PE binaries

     The best approach would be if simple PE binaries can be created with
     the BIN format, with additional help of some macros. The main problem
     are fixups, there's no way to access the fixup list from the source.

  6. ASSUME extension

     use ASSUME CS:USE16 and ASSUME CS:USE32 to change current offset size
     without changing segments.
